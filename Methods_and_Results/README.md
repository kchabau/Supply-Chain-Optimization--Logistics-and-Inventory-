In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a company's supply chain and sales data. The goal was to uncover key insights that could help optimize operations, improve profitability, and enhance decision-making. Below, we present a series of questions that guided our analysis, along with the SQL queries used to answer them.

We first begin by creating the database and table in which we will be able to import our public data into.

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SupplyChain;
CREATE DATABASE SupplyChain;
USE SupplyChain;

CREATE TABLE Data_Source(
    Product_type VARCHAR(255),
    SKU VARCHAR(255),
    Price FLOAT,
    Availability INT,
    Number_Of_Products_Sold INT,
    Revenue_Generated FLOAT,
    Customer_Demographics VARCHAR(255),
    Stock_Levels INT,
    Lead_Times INT,
    Order_Quantities INT,
    Shipping_Times INT,
    Shipping_Carriers VARCHAR(255),
    Shipping_Cost FLOAT,
    Supplier_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Location VARCHAR(255),
    Lead_Time INT,
    Production_Volume INT,
    Manufacturing_Lead_Time INT,
    Manufactturing_Cost FLOAT,
    Inspection_Results VARCHAR(255),
    Defect_Rate FLOAT,
    Transportation_Modes VARCHAR(255),
    Routes VARCHAR(255),
    Costs FLOAT
);
```

To understand the company's product portfolio, we analyzed the number of products by type and calculated the average price for each category.

```sql
SELECT Product_type,
    COUNT(Product_type) AS Number_of_Products,
    ROUND(AVG(Price), 2) AS Average_Price
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Product_type
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| Product_type | Number_of_Products | Average_Price |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| skincare     | 40                 | 47.26         |
| haircare     | 34                 | 46.01         |
| cosmetics    | 26                 | 57.36         |

The inventory is dominated by skincare products (40), followed by haircare (34) and cosmetics (26). Despite having the fewest products, cosmetics have the highest average price ($57.36), suggesting a premium category, while skincare ($47.26) and haircare ($46.01) are priced similarly. This may indicate a strategic focus on skincare variety and a niche market for high-value cosmetics.

We identified the top-performing products based on the total quantities sold. This helps in recognizing which products are most popular among customers.

```sql
SELECT Product_Type,
    SKU,
    SUM(Order_Quantities) AS '# of Orders'
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Product_Type, SKU
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| Product_Type | SKU   | # of Orders |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| haircare     | SKU0  | 96          |
| skincare     | SKU90 | 96          |
| cosmetics    | SKU33 | 95          |
| skincare     | SKU19 | 94          |
| haircare     | SKU2  | 88          |
| cosmetics    | SKU38 | 88          |
| haircare     | SKU43 | 85          |
| cosmetics    | SKU17 | 85          |
| cosmetics    | SKU35 | 85          |
| haircare     | SKU12 | 85          |

Conversely, we also looked at the least sold products to identify potential underperformers that may require attention.

```sql
SELECT Product_Type,
    SKU,
    SUM(Order_Quantities) AS '# of Orders'
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Product_Type, SKU
ORDER BY 3 ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

| Product_Type | SKU   | # of Orders |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| haircare     | SKU74 | 1           |
| haircare     | SKU24 | 2           |
| haircare     | SKU97 | 4           |
| haircare     | SKU46 | 6           |
| haircare     | SKU83 | 7           |
| cosmetics    | SKU21 | 7           |
| haircare     | SKU81 | 8           |
| haircare     | SKU48 | 9           |
| cosmetics    | SKU49 | 9           |
| cosmetics    | SKU92 | 10          |

The **highest-selling products** are evenly distributed across skincare, haircare, and cosmetics, with the top SKUs receiving around 95â€“96 orders, indicating strong demand across all categories. **Skincare and haircare** lead in **order volume**, with cosmetics closely following. In contrast, the **lowest-selling SKUs** are predominantly **haircare products**, with some cosmetics items also seeing minimal demand. The lowest-performing products receive between 1 and 10 orders, suggesting either low popularity or overstocking issues. This disparity highlights potential opportunities for **inventory optimization** and **targeted marketing strategies**.

We analyzed sales performance across different locations to understand regional contributions to total revenue.

```sql
SELECT Location,
    Product_type,
    ROUND(SUM(Revenue_generated), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
    SUM(Order_Quantities) AS '# of Orders'
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Location, Product_type
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

| Location  | Product_type | Total_Revenue | # of Orders |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Kolkata   | skincare     | 77886.27      | 644         |
| Chennai   | skincare     | 58957.42      | 472         |
| Bangalore | haircare     | 51654.35      | 297         |
| Mumbai    | cosmetics    | 49156.51      | 356         |
| Mumbai    | haircare     | 44423.98      | 359         |
| Mumbai    | skincare     | 44174.54      | 368         |
| Delhi     | cosmetics    | 37429.68      | 405         |
| Kolkata   | haircare     | 35027.71      | 435         |
| Bangalore | skincare     | 31637.82      | 358         |
| Chennai   | cosmetics    | 31461.95      | 319         |
| Delhi     | skincare     | 28972.12      | 257         |
| Chennai   | haircare     | 28723.45      | 318         |
| Kolkata   | cosmetics    | 24163.57      | 149         |
| Bangalore | cosmetics    | 19309.56      | 114         |
| Delhi     | haircare     | 14625.9       | 71          |

Skincare products generate the highest revenue, with **Kolkata leading at $77,886.27 from 644 orders**, followed by **Chennai at $58,957.42 from 472 orders**. Haircare sees strong demand in Bangalore ($51,654.35, 297 orders) and Mumbai ($44,423.98, 359 orders), while **cosmetics perform best in Mumbai** ($49,156.51, 356 orders) and **Delhi** ($37,429.68, 405 orders). Kolkata and Chennai dominate skincare sales, whereas Mumbai has a balanced demand across all categories. Lower revenue figures for haircare in Delhi ($14,625.90, 71 orders) and cosmetics in Bangalore ($19,309.56, 114 orders) **suggest potential gaps in market reach or consumer preference shifts**.

Understanding lead times is crucial for supply chain efficiency. We calculated the average lead time for each supplier to identify potential bottlenecks.

```sql
SELECT Supplier_Name,
    ROUND(AVG(Lead_Times), 2) AS Average_Lead_Times,
    ROUND(AVG(Lead_Time), 2) AS Average_Lead_Time
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Supplier_Name
ORDER BY Supplier_Name;
```

| Supplier_Name | Average_Lead_Times | Average_Lead_Time |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Supplier 1    | 16.78              | 14.78             |
| Supplier 2    | 16.23              | 18.55             |
| Supplier 3    | 14.33              | 20.13             |
| Supplier 4    | 17.00              | 15.22             |
| Supplier 5    | 14.72              | 18.06             |

Supplier lead times vary significantly, impacting supply chain efficiency. Supplier 3 has the longest average lead time (20.13 days), while Supplier 1 has the shortest (14.78 days), suggesting potential reliability concerns for faster fulfillment. Supplier 2 and Supplier 5 have relatively high lead times (18.55 and 18.06 days, respectively), which may affect inventory planning. Supplier 4 maintains a moderate lead time of 15.22 days, balancing speed and consistency. These variations highlight the **need for strategic supplier selection to optimize order fulfillment and reduce delays**.

We broke down revenue by product type to identify which categories are the most profitable.

```sql
SELECT Product_Type,
    ROUND(SUM(Revenue_generated), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(Revenue_Generated) - SUM(Costs), 2) AS Profit,
    ROUND(SUM(Revenue_generated) / SUM(Number_Of_Products_Sold), 2) AS 'Revenue per Product',
    SUM(Number_Of_Products_Sold) AS '# of Products Sold',
    SUM(Order_Quantities) AS '# of Orders'
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Product_Type
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

| Product_Type | Total_Revenue | Profit    | Revenue - Costs | Revenue per Product | # of Products Sold | # of Orders |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| skincare     | 241628.16     | 219398.84 | 22229.32        | 11.66               | 20731              | 2099        |
| haircare     | 174455.39     | 157126.53 | 17328.86        | 12.82               | 13611              | 1480        |
| cosmetics    | 161521.27     | 148154.87 | 13366.4         | 13.74               | 11757              | 1343        |

Skincare products generate the highest total revenue ($241,628.16) and profit ($219,398.84), with 20,731 units sold across 2,099 orders. Haircare follows with $174,455.39 in revenue and $157,126.53 in profit, while cosmetics bring in $161,521.27 in revenue and $148,154.87 in profit. **Cosmetics** have the **highest revenue per product** ($13.74), followed by haircare ($12.82) and skincare ($11.66), suggesting that cosmetics **may have higher pricing or margins per unit**. **Despite having the most sales and orders, skincare has the lowest revenue per product, indicating a volume-driven strategy.**

Profitability is key to business success. We identified the top 10 products that generate the highest profit.

```sql
SELECT SKU,
    Product_Type,
    Revenue_generated - Costs AS Profit
FROM Data_Source
ORDER BY Profit DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| SKU   | Product_Type | Profit            |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| SKU2  | haircare     | 9435.829711914062 |
| SKU38 | cosmetics    | 9352.645477294922 |
| SKU88 | cosmetics    | 9340.825942993164 |
| SKU67 | skincare     | 9304.52604675293  |
| SKU51 | haircare     | 9171.483520507812 |
| SKU31 | skincare     | 9045.75555419922  |
| SKU99 | haircare     | 8974.44253540039  |
| SKU52 | skincare     | 8832.864196777344 |
| SKU32 | skincare     | 8810.376892089844 |
| SKU18 | haircare     | 8771.193542480469 |

The relatively close profit values suggest that no single SKU significantly outperforms the rest, highlighting a balanced contribution to overall profitability.

We analyzed lead times by product type to identify which categories may be experiencing delays in the supply chain.

```sql
SELECT Product_type,
    AVG(Lead_Times) AS Average_Lead_Time,
    AVG(Stock_Levels) AS Average_Stock_Level,
    AVG(Availability) AS Average_Availability
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Product_type
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

| Product_type | Average_Lead_Time | Average_Stock_Level | Average_Availability |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| skincare     | 16.7000           | 40.2000             | 50.9250              |
| haircare     | 15.5294           | 48.3529             | 43.2647              |
| cosmetics    | 15.3846           | 58.6538             | 51.2308              |

Skincare products have the highest average lead time (16.7 days) but maintain a moderate stock level (40.2) and the highest availability (50.93%). Haircare products have a slightly lower lead time (15.53 days) and the second-highest stock level (48.35) but the lowest availability (43.26%). Cosmetics have the shortest lead time (15.38 days) and the highest stock level (58.65), contributing to a relatively high availability rate (51.23%). This suggests that **while cosmetics are restocked more quickly and kept in higher quantities, skincare products maintain the best balance between stock and availability despite longer lead times**.

We examined transportation modes and routes to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain, focusing on lead times and costs.

```sql
SELECT Transportation_Modes AS Transportation,
    Routes,
    ROUND(AVG(Lead_Times), 2) AS Average_Lead_Time,
    ROUND(AVG(Costs), 2) AS Average_Costs
FROM Data_Source
GROUP BY Transportation_Modes, Routes
ORDER BY 3 ASC, 1, 2;
```

| Transportation | Routes  | Average_Lead_Time | Average_Costs |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Sea            | Route B | 9.83              | 564.34        |
| Sea            | Route C | 10.50             | 341.78        |
| Rail           | Route A | 12.43             | 485.05        |
| Rail           | Route C | 14.00             | 456.94        |
| Sea            | Route A | 15.14             | 335.68        |
| Air            | Route A | 15.64             | 527.35        |
| Road           | Route A | 16.36             | 539.49        |
| Road           | Route C | 17.00             | 586.54        |
| Road           | Route B | 17.85             | 552.39        |
| Rail           | Route B | 18.27             | 637.04        |
| Air            | Route C | 19.75             | 542.35        |
| Air            | Route B | 20.71             | 637.84        |

Sea transportation generally offers the shortest lead times and lower costs, with Route B (9.83 days, $564.34) being the fastest. Rail transport has moderate lead times, with Route A (12.43 days, $485.05) being the most efficient among them. Air transportation tends to have the longest lead times and the highest costs, with Route B being the most expensive at $637.84. Road transport also has longer lead times, with Route C (17 days) being the slowest. **Overall**, **sea** routes provide a **balance of speed and affordability**, while air and road routes trade off higher costs for longer transit times.

Finally, we evaluated supplier performance based on inspection results to ensure quality and reliability in the supply chain.

```sql
SELECT Supplier_Name,
    SUM(Pass) AS Pass,
    SUM(Fail) AS Fail,
    SUM(Pending) AS Pending,
    SUM(Pass) + SUM(Fail) + SUM(Pending) AS Total_Inspections,
    ROUND(SUM(Pass) / (SUM(Pass) + SUM(Fail) + SUM(Pending)) * 100, 2) AS Pass_Percentage,
    ROUND(SUM(Fail) / (SUM(Pass) + SUM(Fail) + SUM(Pending)) * 100, 2) AS Fail_Percentage,
    ROUND(SUM(Pending) / (SUM(Pass) + SUM(Fail) + SUM(Pending)) * 100, 2) AS Pending_Percentage
FROM (
    SELECT Supplier_Name,
        Inspection_Results,
        CASE
            WHEN Inspection_Results = 'Pass' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS Pass,
        CASE
            WHEN Inspection_Results = 'Fail' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS Fail,
        CASE
            WHEN Inspection_Results = 'Pending' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS Pending
    FROM Data_Source
) AS subquery
GROUP BY Supplier_Name
ORDER BY Supplier_Name;
```

| Supplier_Name | Pass | Fail | Pending | Total_Inspections | Pass_Percentage | Fail_Percentage | Pending_Percentage |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Supplier 1    | 13   | 6    | 8       | 27                | 48.15           | 22.22           | 29.63              |
| Supplier 2    | 5    | 8    | 9       | 22                | 22.73           | 36.36           | 40.91              |
| Supplier 3    | 2    | 3    | 10      | 15                | 13.33           | 20.00           | 66.67              |
| Supplier 4    | 0    | 12   | 6       | 18                | 0.00            | 66.67           | 33.33              |
| Supplier 5    | 3    | 7    | 8       | 18                | 16.67           | 38.89           | 44.44              |

**Supplier 1 has the highest pass percentage** (48.15%) but still has a significant number of pending inspections (29.63%).
