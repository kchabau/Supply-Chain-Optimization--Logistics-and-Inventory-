# Supply Chain Optimization (Logistics & Inventory)


*(Still a work in progress)*

Supply chain analytics plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making across industries like manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on the flow of products and services from suppliers to customers.

This project focuses on optimizing supply chain operations, including logistics and inventory management, through data-driven insights. Using SQL, I analyze inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, warehouse efficiency, and transportation costs to enhance supply chain performance and reduce operational bottlenecks.

This [Original Dataset](Data/supply_chain_data.csv) comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis). It is a dataset collected from a Fashion and Beauty startup. The dataset is based on the supply chain of Makeup products.

Managing inventory and logistics efficiently is a critical challenge in supply chain management. Companies often struggle with:

- Overstocking or stockouts leading to financial losses.
- Inefficient warehouse utilization impacting order fulfillment.
- High transportation costs due to poor routing decisions.
- Lack of visibility into supply chain performance metrics.

This project aims to tackle these challenges by leveraging SQL for data analysis and optimization.

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MySQL) – Data querying and manipulation.
- Tableau / Power BI – Data visualization and reporting.
- Excel / Google Sheets – Data preprocessing and validation.

## Questions Answerable Using SQL

**This project enables answering key business questions such as:**

- What are the top-selling and least-selling products? ✔️
- Which warehouses have the highest and lowest stock turnover rates?
- How often do stockouts occur, and for which products?
- What is the average lead time for each supplier? ✔️
- Which customers generate the highest revenue? ✔️ _in a way_
- Studying defect rate.
  - What is the average defect rate per product type?
  - What are our results for inspections? (Pending v. Fail v. Pass)
- How much does each transportation route cost on average?
- What are the most frequent reasons for delayed shipments?
- What is the reorder point for each product to avoid stockouts?

- How many products does the company have? 
- What Are the Top 10 Products by Total Quantities Sold? (Best v Worst Performers)
- What Is the Sum of Sales for Each Location?
- What Is the Average Lead Time for Each Supplier?
- What Is the Sum of Revenue Generated by Product Type?
- What Are the Top 10 Products by Profit?
- Which Product Type Has the Highest Average Lead Time?
- Which Transportation Modes and Routes Have the Highest Average Lead Time and Costs?
- What Are the Suppliers' Inspection Results?

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of data normalization for efficient querying.
- Using indexes and optimized SQL queries for performance enhancement.
- The impact of accurate inventory forecasting on reducing costs.
- Integration of SQL with visualization tools for better decision-making.

### Future Enhancements

- Implement machine learning models for demand forecasting.
- Automate inventory restocking alerts.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time tracking of supply chain KPIs.
- Enhance database security and access control mechanisms.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in optimizing supply chain operations. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
